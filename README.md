# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis Using Data Science Techniques

## 📌 Objective
This project analyzes **global air quality data** using data science techniques to identify trends, correlations, and predictive insights. The dataset includes key air pollutants (**PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3**) and environmental factors (**temperature, humidity, wind speed**) from various global cities. The goal is to develop a model that helps researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists **monitor air quality and assess its impact on human health**.

##  Key Features & Methodologies
✔ **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying correlations, trends, and outliers in pollution levels.  
✔ **Classification Analysis**: Categorizing Air Quality Index (AQI) levels into "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy," and "Hazardous" using a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
✔ **Regression Modeling**: Using **Linear Regression** to predict pollutant levels based on environmental conditions.  
✔ **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables like **Temperature-Humidity Interaction** to enhance model performance.  

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Strong correlation** found between PM2.5 and PM10, indicating common sources of pollution.  
- **High classification accuracy** in predicting AQI categories, though further testing on diverse datasets is needed.  
- **Regression analysis** revealed how climate factors influence pollution levels, providing valuable insights for air quality management.
